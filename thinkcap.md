# Thinking Cap - Sebastien Dills

### What are your thoughts on "thick mapping in the digital humanities," and how does it differ from "mapping?" 
Thick mapping serves to add as much context as possible to a map. I feel as if for every layer you add you also need more context to correct for error. This allows users of a map to understand the context of a place and more fully understand what the developer is trying to convery. It differs from mapping in the sense that this is a much more involved process. A thick map aims to offer multiple viewpoints and fully contexualize. 

### How does the theory of "thick mapping" inform narratives that are influencing your life? 
Add context (historical or otherwise) has extensive and obvious value. We use maps consantly (Google Maps, Postmates, Uber), so have detailed and accurate maps has pretty obvious value. This is true in an academic sense as well, most data has a geographic component so it's easy to see how thick mapping with multiple layers and data sets is valuable and possible. Understanding is everything. It enables you to follow your morals and find a best course of action for whatever it is you want for the world.
