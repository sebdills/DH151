    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> My name is Sebastien Dills and I am a 3rd year Economics major from Boston Mass. 
        I will be interning with a company called Netapp this summer working in pricing and strategy. Working in tech and business
    does not interest me long term. My long term goals are to become finanically indepedent as young as I can and then get involved in local and state government.
    My main goals for this class are developing my hard skills and learning new programing languages. I see programing as a really
    cool creative outlet that can help develope my problem solving skills. I strongly believe there need to be more data driven solutions in all levels of government.
    I feel very strongly about the enviornment so GIS technolgies are very helpful in that context. I want to work in local government because
    the goal of saving the planet is very overwheling so I think starting small is best for me. <b> Example of bold text.</b> <i> Example of italics.</i>

    <ul>
        <li> The website I linked is about how there is more debt than money in this world. </li>
        <li> This idea is very interesting to me for several reasons. </li>
        <li> I started reading about modern monitary theory because of it. </li>
        <li> This is basically the idea the debts and liabilities come before assets and money. </li>
        <li> It is typically thought that this is reversed. </li>
    </ul>
