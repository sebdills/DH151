Link to Website: https://www.getloke.com/skate-spots

The goal of the site is to share pictures and locations of skate spots all around the world. You can navigate to different locations and as you zoom in the little balls with numbers on them eventually seperate into actual location markers for different locations to skate. This website speaks to me because it offers a service that I personally find useful and interesting. This is a very difficult concept to make for many reasons and this is the best website I have seen attept this issue. The mapping is very simple it just groups together skate spots in circles that grow depending on the concentrations of a number of spots in a specific area (LA for example has a lot so the circle is large). You can zoom in and find spots in specific locations or just look around. This website uses google maps. There are several things I would change. Firstly I would add some options to click on the circles before they individually turn in to markers. Like you could click on a circle and see a list of all the spots in that area. Secondly there are a few bugs with when you click on spots that need to be fixed.
